<b>Protocol Number: KitizenScience_v1.0

<h3>
	Purpose of this study
</h3>

<p>
	We collect survey and demographic data so we can understand our volunteers and the experience you bring to Kitizen Science, and so we can compare our volunteer demographics with those of other citizen science projects.  We also track volunteer activity on our website and app, including the total amount of time you spend logged in as a volunteer, the number of cat photo submissions you upload or process, and the route and distance you walk if you volunteer to use our app to conduct cat surveys.
</p>

<h3>
How we use this data
</h3>

<p>
This data will not be published in a way that makes it identifiable to you as an individual but will be published and shared in discussing our volunteers and how they participate in Kitizen Science.  This includes reporting the average amount of time volunteers spend on Kitizen Science per month, the gender breakdown of our volunteers, and other metrics of engagement and activity.  We also include the routes and distances traveled by app users in the statistical analysis of cat populations.
