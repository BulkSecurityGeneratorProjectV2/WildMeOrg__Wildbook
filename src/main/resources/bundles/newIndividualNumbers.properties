# Deprecated! Move my contents over to locationID.json
# Here’s what the new JSON should look like in locationID.json:
# "name": "Cameroon",
# 			"id": "Cameroon",
# 			"defaultLatitude": 5.3, "defaultLongitude": 12.5,
# 			"locationID": [
# 				{
# 					"name": "BeNP",
# 					"id": "BeNP",
# 					"description": "BeNP",
# 					"prefix": "BeNP",
# 					"prefixDigitPadding": 4,
# 					"defaultLatitude": 1.270203, "defaultLongitude": 37.382723
# 				}
# 			]
# Note the two new properties, “prefix” and “prefixDigitPadding”.
# In this case, adding a new MarkedIndividual with an associated encounter having locationID of BeNP could get the ID BeNP0001 (or whatever the next available number is). If “prefixDigitPadding” had the value 5 instead, it would have been BeNP00001.
# If BeNP had no prefix (or prefixDigitPadding) listed in the BeNP node but there were one for Cameroon, that one would be used instead. In other words, when naming by locationID, WB will now traverse upwards into the parent locationID nodes until it finds a prefix (or fails, in which case null gets returned).
# Same is true for prefixDigitPadding, but it will default to 3 instead.
